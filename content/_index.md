# An Outer Sphere of Thoughts

---

I'm Nico, a writer of mostly Tabletop RPG things. I've made several things, for examples two epistolary games games which you may find in anthologies [here](https://far-horizons-co-op.itch.io/sgd8) and [here](https://far-horizons-co-op.itch.io/anthology-2-1).

Although my tastes changed some time after that and now I mostly write things ***for*** games than things that want to be ***games***.

You can find one of them in the Violence Collection at the Spearwitch store [here](https://spearwitch.com/products/violence-collection).

I'll be posting even more things in my [blog](/posts) entries!
