## Assumptions

**Start at 17 years of age**. By the end of character creation, you're assumed be a survivor in this world.

Each **Skill** adds a +1, +2, or +3 to a 2d6 roll. You only roll 2d6 when doing risky things like shooting a foe in a firefight or trying to pick a lock under duress. The number you need to beat is always an 8, no more, no less.

At times you roll with **Advantage or Disadvantage** which is rolling 3d6 and taking the two highest or lowest d6's, respectively.

Apply multiple Skills to a single roll if applicable.

## Background and Education

Decide on an ethnicity and or nationality. Choose whether you grew up here or not. You are fluent in 1d3+1 languages.

Roll 2d6 to determine your level of education. Some careers have a mandatory minimum for education level.

## Careers

To gain skills for your character, choose a career. After choosing Secondary Vocation, your first term must always be either Educational or Military Grunt. Subsequent terms must be Educational, Civilian, or Military. Only roll on the Civilian or Military table once.

Each term ages your character by 4 years.

After the first term, roll 1d6. There's a 1-in-6 chance you are drafted into the military. The chances go up per succeeding term. 2-in-6 next term, then 3-in-6, and so on until you are assuredly absorbed into service. If that's the case, you may no longer choose an Educational or Civilian Career. Roll on the Military table.

If you are a foreign national, you may still be drafted by your country of origin, but stop rolling after a 3-in-6 chance.

At any point in time, even at 17 years old, you may start play.

### Secondary Vocations

Any of these are hobbies or specializations you chose to develop throughout your youth.

Roll twice. These start at +1.

### Educational

Choose from below, but make sure you fulfill the requirements for entry. Roll twice on every term for Skills. Only roll for Skills twice. The first grants it at +2 and the second at +3. Roll again freely should you roll for the same skill more than twice.

A ballistic vest adds 4 more quick slots.
